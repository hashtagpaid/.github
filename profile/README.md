## Hello, nice to meet you üëã

### #Ô∏è‚É£ About #paid

[#paid](https://www.hashtagpaid.com?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=org-page) is a creator marketing platform that sits at the intersection of brand and creator collaboration. We help direct-to-consumer and Fortune 500 brands like Phillips Hue, Everlywell, Unilever, and Sephora, activate creators to drive growth.

As the leader in the creator marketing space, #paid offers end-to-end workflow management, including easily matching brands with creators, approving content, automating payments and legal agreements, and reporting on sales impact and ROI.

### üíª Our tech stack

We use a range of technologies to get the job done: JavaScript and Node.js coupled with Fastify, React, Ionic, Tailwind CSS, Capacitor, and other libraries to provide a modern, easy-to-use **Javascript** toolchain. A RESTful API back-end powers our platform services.

We use **Terraform** to manage our infrastructure in **Google Cloud Platform**, and leverage GCP monitoring tools to monitor the performance of our applications.

We host our codebase on **Github** and use Github Actions to streamline our workflows and automate a variety of tasks, from standard software development life cycle tasks (build, test, lint, deploy) to dependency updates, semantically versioned releases, and much more.

We believe in concise and clear documentation, and we use **OAS 3.0** for API design and documentation.

### ü§ù Our interview process

Two rounds of interviews across two days with four different components.

- Hiring Manager Interview (60 mins). We want to learn more about your experience and interests at this stage. You will also learn about the engineering team and decide if #paid is the right fit for you.

- Meet the team (60 mins). You will meet Product, Design and Engineering team members to learn how you collaborate across these disciplines. You will also have an opportunity to ask about our team structure and culture.

- Project Deep Dive (60 mins). You will meet the architecture team and talk in-depth about a past project or codebase you loved (or hated!). Come prepared to talk about technical topics (architecture, trade-offs and tools) and non-technical details (team structure, project planning, lessons learned and overall business impact). You are welcome to present slides or a codebase, but remember that this interview is a conversation, not a presentation.

- VP interview (30 mins). Intended to cover your skills in collaboration and communication, as well as to provide a final opportunity for you to ask any lingering questions about the company strategy.

Note: this is an outline of interviewing at #paid. The interview process may vary depending on your experience.
