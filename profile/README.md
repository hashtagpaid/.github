## Hello, nice to meet you üëã

### #Ô∏è‚É£ About #paid

[#paid](https://www.hashtagpaid.com?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=org-page) is a creator marketing platform that sits at the intersection of brand and creator collaboration. We help direct-to-consumer and Fortune 500 brands like Infiniti, TJX, Unilever, and Sephora, activate creators to drive growth.

As the leader in the creator marketing space, #paid offers end-to-end workflow management, including easily matching brands with creators, approving content, automating payments and legal agreements, and reporting on sales impact and ROI.

### üíª Our tech stack

We use a range of technologies to get the job done: JavaScript and Node.js coupled with Fastify, OpenAPI, React, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Storybook and other open source tools to provide a modern, easy-to-use Javascript toolchain. A RESTful API back-end powers our platform services.

We use **Terraform** to manage our infrastructure in **Google Cloud Platform**, and leverage GCP monitoring tools to monitor the performance of our applications.

We host our codebase on **Github** and use Github Actions to streamline our workflows and automate a variety of tasks, from standard software development life cycle tasks (build, test, lint, deploy) to dependency updates, semantically versioned releases, and much more.

We believe in concise and clear documentation, and we use **OAS 3.0** for API design and documentation.
